> Hosts file
    - Write a check for the existence of host file
    - Work on exceptions for hosts (if file exists, if it doesn't, does it contain custom entries, etc)
    - Allow user to import their own file containing ip entries
> Service manipulation
    - Create a list of all adobe service names
    - Most likely will use windows subsys for calling service objects directly
    - Check service existence, if it does then disable on startup, etc
> AMTLIB.dll [Simple]
    - Check if the file exists, if it does, make a backup
    - Overwrite all dll files in all adobe paths
        - User will have to enter paths themselves or will it be able to auto-detect? I'll look into it.
> Firewall
    - Probably use windows subsys for this as well, add all adobe products to establish no connection inbound/outbound
> Complete patch functionality
    - This will be the last function I do for completing all patches at once, everything needs to be working perfectly
      for this to work.
> Main
    - Write the skeleton, how everything will interact. Each event (services, amt, hosts) will have their own .py classes
      with multiple functions
